        <p>Hi

            ! My name is Ryan Lee.
        </p><br>
        <p>I studied Earth & Space Sciences with a focus on Physics at the University of Washington.</p>
        <p>I lost interest in both the academia and lab works, and have decided to pivot into programming as a result!</p>
        <p>I am currently enrolled with CodeFellows for their 201 program. I hope to become a capable software engineer within the year!</p>
